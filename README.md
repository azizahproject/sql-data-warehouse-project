# Data Warehouse & Analytics Project

## 📁 Overview
This project is developed as part of the **Data Warehouse Course by [DataWithBaraa]([https://www.youtube.com/@DataWithBaraa](https://youtu.be/9GVqKuTVANE?si=AuaewLte6OVauUrR))** on YouTube.  
It demonstrates the implementation of a complete **Data Warehouse (DWH)** using the **Bronze–Silver–Gold layered architecture**.  

The project aims to ensure data reliability, traceability, and consistency across all transformation stages — from raw ingestion to analytical consumption.  
It includes real-world practices such as data cleansing, standardization, integration, and quality validation.

   1. Bronze Layer:  Raw data ingestion layer | Stores unprocessed, original data from CRM and ERP source systems. |
   
   2. Silver Layer: Cleansed & conformed layer | Standardizes, validates, and integrates data for analytical use. |

   3. Gold Layer: Analytical layer | Contains curated, business-ready datasets for reporting and insights. |
